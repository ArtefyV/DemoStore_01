# Demo Store 01

**Demo application of an online store**.

The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate the functionality of the online store within the technical specifications set by the company.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Create, update, delete, and view products.
- **Order Management**: Create and manage customer orders.
- **Scheduling**: Automatically delete expired orders.
- **Swagger Integration**: Test the application manually through Swagger.
- **JUnit and Integration Tests**: Verify the operations available in the application.

## Architecture and Technical Solutions

The application is built using the following technologies:
- **Java**: The primary programming language.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building the application.
- **Maven**: Build and dependency management tool.
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for testing.
- **Swagger**: API documentation and testing tool.
- **JUnit**: Unit testing framework.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool.

### Application Structure

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic.
- **Repository Layer**: Interacts with the database.
- **Model Layer**: Defines the data structures.

### Technical Solutions

- **Scheduling**: Implemented using `@EnableScheduling` to delete expired orders.
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception handler to manage application errors.
- **Docker**: The application is ready to run in a Docker container.

## Testing

The application is available for testing through Swagger. Additionally, JUnit and integration tests are implemented to verify the operations available in the application.

## Future Improvements

To enhance the application's efficiency and performance, the following improvements can be made:
- **Asynchronous Task Queue**: Replace scheduling with an asynchronous task queue using Kafka or RabbitMQ for better performance in high-load scenarios.
- **Microservices Architecture**: As the application functionality and code base grows, it makes sense to split the application into microservices to allow independent scaling of different components.
- **Cloud Deployment**: The application is currently ready to run in a Docker container. It can be deployed to a cloud service and managed with Kubernetes. This will allow for better scalability and reliability.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring and logging tools like Prometheus, Grafana and ELK stack to track application performance and troubleshoot issues.
- **Security Enhancements**: Implement security measures like HTTPS, CORS, and CSRF protection to secure the application.

## Feature Enhancements

To expand the application's functionality, the following enhancements can be made:
- **Frontend Development**: Currently, the application does not have a frontend, but it can be developed later.
- **Localization System**: Implement a national localization system for the product catalog, including different language versions of product names, measurement units, and currencies for respective countries.
- **Product Data Enhancement**: Expand the product details to include product images, packaging information, size and weight, and descriptions of consumer qualities.
- **User Authorization System**: Implement a user authorization system to manage user access and permissions.
- **Administrative Interface**: Create an administrative interface accessible only to authorized personnel, incorporating part of the existing functionality.
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Integrate a payment gateway to allow customers to make payments online.
- **Order Tracking System**: Implement an order tracking system to allow customers to track their orders.
- **Customer Feedback System**: Implement a customer feedback system to collect and analyze customer reviews and ratings.
- **Recommendation System**: Implement a recommendation system to suggest products to customers based on their preferences and purchase history.
- **Mobile Application Development**: Develop a mobile application for the online store to reach a wider audience.
- **Subscription Service**: Implement a subscription service for customers to receive regular deliveries of products.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Implement analytics and reporting tools to track sales, customer behavior, and other key metrics.
- **SEO Optimization**: Optimize the application for search engines to improve visibility and attract more customers.

## Data Storage Improvements

To improve data storage and handling under high load, the following solutions can be considered:
- **Relational Database**: Use PostgreSQL or MySQL for storing structured data such as products, orders, and users.
- **NoSQL Database**: Use MongoDB or Cassandra for storing unstructured data such as documents and image collections.
- **Cloud Storage**: Use Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage for storing large volumes of data like images and documents.
- **Caching**: Implement caching with Redis or Memcached to improve performance and reduce database load.

## Known Issues

- **Scheduling**: The current implementation of deleting expired orders using scheduling is not optimal for high-load applications. It can be improved by implementing an asynchronous task queue with Kafka or RabbitMQ.

## Conclusion

The Demo Store application is a demonstration of an online store's functionality. It is currently available for testing and can be improved and scaled in the future.
